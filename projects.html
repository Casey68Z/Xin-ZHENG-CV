            <br>
            This paper uses a Difference-in-Differences model, event study, and machine learning techniques to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food-away-from-home demand across the United States. By analyzing data from 2010 to 2023 and using stay-at-home policies as policy event nodes, the study explores post-pandemic demand growth and assesses the environmental implications of these changes.
