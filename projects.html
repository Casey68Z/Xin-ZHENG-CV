            <h3>Working paper - “Removing the Bottleneck of Water in Industrial Upgrading: Evidence from Regional Water Right Transactions in China.”</h3>
            <p>Xin Zheng, Wanqian Luo, Tianshu Li. 2023</p>
           <p>First published at the conference: The 10th International Workshop on Regional,Urban,and Spatial Economics in China.</p>
           <p>Abstract: As an emerging policy endeavor, China initiated the official water right trading platform in 2016, and many inter-regional water transactions occurred by taking advantage of the existing natural and artificial water courses. This paper adopts multiple quasi-experimental methodologies to empirically study the economic impact of water transactions recorded by the China Water Exchange since 2016.</p>
           <p>Using remoting-sensing and county-level panel data, we find that the buyer regions experience expansions of both agricultural and urban land uses, while the seller regions switch from agricultural to urban land uses. These changes are further evidenced by rising industrial development zones in both of the trading regions. Such efficiency improvement in regional water allocation further leads to an increasing on average in annual GDP and a sectoral upgrading towards secondary industries in the buyer regions, while the seller regions exhibit mostly muted effects in overall economic development.</p>
